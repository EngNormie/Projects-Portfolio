There has been increased escalations on service delivery and client satisfaction levels came down by 8 percentage points.\n","\n","The CEO, Mr. Brain decided to initiate a data science project, which analyses the current employee data and finds the core underlying causes of these performance issues. Project findings are expected to help the company take the right course of actions, and provide clear indicators of non performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employees, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals.\n","\n","The original dataset for this analysis is from [IABAC](http://data.iabac.org/exam/p2/data/INX_Future_Inc_Employee_Performance_CDS_Project2_Data_V1.8.xls).\n","\n","Expected insights are:\n","\n","- Department wise performances,\n","- Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance,\n","- A trained model which can predict employee performance based on factors as inputs.
