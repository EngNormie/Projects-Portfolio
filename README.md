## Projects Portfolio

This repository is a selected compilation of my projects spanning my career practice in data analysis, data science, artificial intelligence, business process modeling and automation. These projects are meant to showcase skills as well as help others acquire highly demanded tech skills in modern enterprises.

* Datasets used for the analysis are located in the other [Datasets](https://github.com/EngNormie/Datasets/) repository. Find more datasets in my [Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/technormie/)

* Data visualization files are located in the [Data-Visualizations](https://github.com/EngNormie/Data-Visualization) repository.

I've arranged sample projects by topic in the table below. Click on a topic of interest to navigate to project details.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

## Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
### [Sales Prediction](https://github.com/EngNormie/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/Sales%20Prediction.ipynb)
This problem requires use of relevant machine learning steps and appropriate model to predict total sales using features like money spent on Advertising/Marketing. The analysis is based on [Advertising Dataset](https://github.com/EngNormie/Datasets/blob/main/Advertising.csv). You can also download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/technormie/advertising-and-sales) 

### [Google Bard](https://github.com/EngNormie/Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/BardAPI%20in%20Jupyter%202.ipynb)
Bard, a Large Language Model (LLM) by Google AI can be accessed in Jupyter Notebooks through the Bard-API Python package. Follow the steps below to start interacting with Bard in your jupyter notebooks;
