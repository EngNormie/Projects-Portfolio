### Recommendations for Improvement

1.	**Optimize Procurement Costs:** Focus on reducing costs for the top five most expensive products by negotiating supplier contracts or finding alternative sourcing options.
2.	**Enhance Sales Performance:** Investigate the recent revenue decline and implement targeted marketing campaigns to boost sales in weaker-performing channels.

4.	**Channel Strategy Optimization:** Since wholesale generates the highest revenue, consider further investments in bulk sales and distribution partnerships to strengthen this channel.
5.	**Product Portfolio Management:** Maintain a strategic focus on high-margin products while evaluating the profitability of lower-margin items for potential discontinuation or pricing adjustments.
6.	**Data-Driven Decision Making:** Regularly monitor inventory metrics in Power BI to identify trends, optimize stock levels, and enhance overall profitability.
